# Debug-Plotter README

Debug-Plotter is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance debugging capabilities by allowing developers to track variable changes over time. This extension is particularly useful for monitoring the behavior of variables or expressions during the debug session, offering insights that can be critical for understanding and resolving issues in your code.

## Features

- **Real-Time Variable Tracking:** Easily add variables or expressions to monitor their changes in real-time during a debug session.
- **Multi-threading Support:** Debug-Plotter is designed to handle multi-threaded applications, ensuring that variable tracking is accurate across different threads.
- **Visualization and Tabulation:** Variables are not only plotted graphically to visualize their changes over time but also listed in a table for precise value inspection. This dual approach provides a comprehensive view of your data.
- **Support for Various Data Types:** While numbers are visually represented, non-plottable variable types are still captured and displayed in the table, ensuring no data is overlooked.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code: Make sure you have the latest version of VS Code installed to ensure compatibility.
- Debugger: A compatible debugger extension for your programming language should be installed and configured in VS Code.

## Extension Settings

Currently, Debug-Plotter does not require specific settings adjustments. It works out of the box once installed, but future updates may introduce configurable options to tailor the extension to your needs.

## Known Issues

As of now, there are no known issues with Debug-Plotter. The development team is committed to promptly addressing any bugs or problems as they are discovered. Users are encouraged to report any issues they encounter on the GitHub repository.
